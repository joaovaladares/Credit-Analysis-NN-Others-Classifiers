# Credit-Analysis-NN-Others-Classifiers

This project was an assessment which our goal was to run some Neural Networks and Machine Learning classifiers on a real dataset related to Credit Analysis. 

## Neural Network used:
- MLP

## Machine Learning models used:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

And to finish it was made 4 different versions of Ensemble using those models before (which each of them had 5 to 9 versions including optimizations and better hyperparameters)
